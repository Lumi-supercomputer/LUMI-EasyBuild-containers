# PyTorch container user instructions

**BETA VERSION and there are still problems with some containers.**

The rocm container is developed by AMD specifically for LUMI and contains the
necessary parts explore ROCm. The use is rather limited at the moment as there
is no easy way to build upon an existing container on LUMI.

The EasyBuild installation with the EasyConfigs mentioned below will do two things:

1.  It will copy the container to your own file space. We realise containers can be
    big, but it ensures that you have complete control over when a container is
    removed again.
    
    We will remove a container from the system when it is not sufficiently functional
    anymore, but the container may still work for you.

    If you prefer to use the centrally provided container, you can remove your copy 
    after loading of the module with `rm $SIF` followed by reloading the module. This
    is however at your own risk. 

2.  It will create a module file. 
    When loading the module, a number of environment variables will
    be set to help you use the module and to make it easy to swap the module with a
    different version in your job scripts.
    
    -   `SIF` and `SIFROCM` both contain the name and full path of the singularity
        container file.
        
    -   `SINGULARITY_BINDPATH` will mount all necessary directories from the system,
        including everything that is needed to access the project, scratch and flash
        file systems.
        

## Installation

To install the container with EasyBuild, follow the instructions in the
[EasyBuild section of the LUMI documentation, section "Software"](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/installing/easybuild/),
and use the dummy partition `container`, e.g.:

```
module load LUMI partition/container EasyBuild-user
eb rocm-5.6.1-singularity-20231108.eb
```

To use the container after installation, the `EasyBuild-user` module is not needed nor
is the `container` partition. The module will be available in all versions of the LUMI stack
and in [the `CrayEnv` stack](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/lumi_env/softwarestacks/#crayenv)
(provided the environment variable `EBU_USER_PREFIX` points to the right location).
