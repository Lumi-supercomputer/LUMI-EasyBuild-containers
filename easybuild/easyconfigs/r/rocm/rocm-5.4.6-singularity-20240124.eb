description = """
This module provides a container with ROCm %(version)s. 

The module defines a number of environment variables:
*   SIF and SIFPYTORCH: The full path and name of the Singularity SIF file 
    to use with singularity exec etc.
*   SINGULAIRTY_BINDPATH: Mounts the necessary directories from the system,
    including /users, /project, /scratch and /flash so that you should be
    able to use your regular directories in the container.
    
As this container only contains ROCm and the basic tools to build, it is
of relatively limited use.

Note that there is no guarantee that this container will play nice with
Cray MPICH. Some older versions of Cray MPICH are broken with much newer
versions of ROCm.
